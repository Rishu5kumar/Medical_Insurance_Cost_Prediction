#### **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**

The **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction** project aims to predict the medical insurance charges based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region. This is a regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous outcome(insurance charges).

**Key Steps and Techniques Used:**
- **Data Collection and Analysis:**
  - Loaded the insurance dataset and conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of different variables and check for missing values.
  - Visualized the distribution of variables like age, BMI, children, smoker status, and region using histograms and count plots to gain insights into the dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Encoded categorical features such as 'sex', 'smoker', and 'region' into numerical values using dictionary mapping to prepare the data for modeling.
  
- **Model Building:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
  - Employed Linear Regression, a standard approach for predicting a continuous outcome, to model the relationship between input features and insurance charges.
  - Evaluated model performance using the R-squared value, which measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data.

- **Prediction System:**
  - Built a prediction system to estimate insurance costs based on user inputs, showcasing the practical application of the trained model.

**Impact:**
- The Medical Insurance Cost Prediction project illustrates the ability to perform regression analysis, a fundamental skill in data science. It demonstrates knowledge of feature encoding, model training, and evaluation, and provides practical insights into cost estimation based on personal and lifestyle factors.
